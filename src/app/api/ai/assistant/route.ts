// Fixed server-side scaffold for the owner-only assistant. Distinct from
// `buildSystemPrompt` in defaults.ts (that one builds the *customer*-
// facing persona from the account's own `ai_configs.system_prompt`) —
// this assistant talks to the account owner about their own business,
// so it gets its own persona and does NOT read the account's custom
// auto-reply instructions at all.
//
// The restrictions below are deliberate product/safety decisions from
// Angel (platform owner), not stylistic guidance — see the 2026-08-17
// "asistente de IA interno" entry in docs/SANDIA_plan_de_desarrollo.md
// for the full rationale. They are always appended here, server-side,
// with no account-level setting able to remove or soften them.
// Built per-request (not a static constant) so it can carry the
// account's actual current date/time — see the `now` line below.
// Without this the model has no clock at all: asked to create a task
// due "in 3 hours" or "at 3pm today" it either had to guess an
// arbitrary date or, as observed in production, ask the owner what
// time it is right now instead of just answering. The customer-facing
// auto-reply prompt (`defaults.ts`'s `calendar` block) already solved
// this the same way for `schedule_appointment`; this assistant just
// never got the equivalent treatment when it gained its own
// time-relative tools (create_task's dueInHours, schedule_appointment).
