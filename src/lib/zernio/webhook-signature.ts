/**
 * Verify the HMAC-SHA256 signature Zernio attaches to webhook POSTs.
 * Shared by every channel's Zernio webhook route (Instagram, Facebook,
 * WhatsApp, ...).
 *
 * Zernio signs the raw request body with the per-webhook secret
 * configured in the Zernio dashboard and sends the result in the
 * `X-Zernio-Signature` header (lowercase hex). Unlike Meta's single
 * app-wide secret, the secret here is per-`*_config` row (each wacrm
 * account creates its own webhook in Zernio with its own secret), so
 * the caller resolves and decrypts the right secret before calling this.
