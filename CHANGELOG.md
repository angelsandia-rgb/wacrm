# Changelog

User-visible changes in `wacrm`. Self-hosters: when pulling an update,
check this file for any **migration required** notes and apply the
matching SQL files from `supabase/migrations/` against your Supabase
project before restarting the app.

Versions follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Pre-1.0, `MINOR` bumps cover new modules; `PATCH` bumps cover bug fixes
and polish.

## [Unreleased]

> **Migration required:** apply `supabase/migrations/104_flow_fallback_default_ai.sql`
> (changes the `flows.fallback_policy` column default so *new* flows send
> an off-menu reply to the AI instead of a human). Existing flows keep
> their current policy — change it per flow in the builder.
>
> **Migration required:** apply `supabase/migrations/105_account_industry_vertical.sql`
> (adds `accounts.industry_vertical`, default `'generic'`, and
> `vertical_applied_at`). Every existing account defaults to `'generic'`
> = today's behaviour, unchanged.
>
> **Migration required:** apply `supabase/migrations/106_product_rates_and_categories.sql`
> (adds `product_categories` + `products.category_id`, and a
> `product_rates` table for per-date room pricing on the hotel vertical).
> No effect until a product actually has rates or a category.
>
> **Migration required:** apply `supabase/migrations/111_product_rates_per_day.sql`
> (renames `product_rates.weekday_group` → `day_of_week` and swaps the
> CHECK to the seven day codes `mon`…`sun`). `product_rates` has no rows
> in any environment, so this is a pure schema swap — no data migration.
>
> **Migration required:** apply `supabase/migrations/112_reservation_requests.sql`
> (new `reservation_requests` table for the hotel vertical — per-category
> service requests that feed a Google Sheet). Empty until a request is
> made; no effect on other verticals.
>
> **Migration required:** apply `supabase/migrations/113_ai_record_reservation.sql`
> (widens the `ai_action_log` action CHECK to allow `record_reservation`).

### Added

- **Hotel: the public catalog takes a service request per category.** For
  a `hotel` account, the catalog detail panel now asks the fields that
  category needs — rooms & packages: check-in / check-out / guests (and
  prices the stay from the per-day rates); spa & activities: date /
  people / minutes; events: date / people — plus the visitor's name and
  phone. Submitting posts a `reservation_requests` row
  (`POST /api/public/catalog/[id]/reservation`, source `catalog`) that
  lands in the category's Google Sheet tab, and shows an on-page recap
  with the estimated total. When the catalog link carries a signed
  `?c=<conversationId>`, the request attaches to that conversation so it
  and the AI chat share one row.
- **Hotel: the AI fills a reservation request from chat.** On a `hotel`
  account, as the guest asks about a room / spa / activity / package /
  event, the auto-reply bot logs each detail it learns — guest count,
  check-in / check-out, a spa duration, an event date — into that
  conversation's `reservation_requests` row (one per category), which
  keeps its Google Sheet row up to date. It records partial data and
  keeps the conversation going instead of handing off or closing when a
  field is still missing. New `RECORD_RESERVATION_SENTINEL_PREFIX`
  marker (taught only to hotel accounts, auto-reply mode) +
  `record_reservation` audit action; the hotel AI prompt scaffold now
  spells out which fields to collect per category.

- **Hotel: reservation/service requests → one Google Sheet tab per
  category (backend).** New `reservation_requests` entity: a per-category
  "solicitud" (habitaciones, spa, actividades, paquetes, eventos) that
  gets filled in over time and mirrored to its own sheet tab
  (`<base> - Habitaciones`, `<base> - Spa`, …). Each category has its own
  columns (rooms: room / guest / check-in / check-out; spa & activities:
  service / people / date / minutes; packages: package / people / dates;
  events: event type / date / people / hall / decoration) plus a trailing
  **"Aprobación"** column the hotel fills by hand — the dispatch rewrites
  the row in place as fields come in but never touches that last column.
  New `reservation.updated` webhook event; `/api/reservations` +
  `/api/reservations/[id]` CRUD (agent+); shared
  `upsertReservationRequest` helper. The hotel starter kit now seeds an
  **Eventos** category and pre-selects `reservation.updated` for Google
  Sheets. The AI tool that fills these from chat, the public-catalog form
  and the quote-builder hook are follow-ups.

- **Hotel rooms priced per day of the week.** The room-rate editor
  (hotel vertical) now takes a distinct price for **every day** — Mon,
  Tue, … Sun — instead of a Mon–Thu / Fri–Sun split, still crossed with
  the 1 / 2 / 3+ guest tiers and optional seasonal date ranges. A "fill
  every day" shortcut seeds all seven rows from one line. The public
  catalog gains a **"Cotiza tu estadía"** panel: the visitor picks
  check-in, check-out and number of guests and the nightly rates price
  the stay client-side (night-by-night breakdown + total), with a
  WhatsApp button that prefills the request. The AI catalog context and
  the products Excel export/import move to the same per-day model — the
  six `rate_weekday*` / `rate_weekend*` columns collapse to one compact
  `room_rates` cell (`mon=800/950/1600;fri=1200//1700`).
- **"New category" button in the product form.** For a hotel company,
  the category picker in the add/edit-product dialog gains an inline
  field to create a category on the spot (`POST /api/product-categories`)
  without leaving the form.

- **Platform admin: "Reenviar acceso" for a company.** A button on the
  company detail in **Plataforma** re-sends an access email to the
  owner — a password-reset link when they already have an account (the
  usual case, e.g. the first invite link was consumed or expired), or a
  fresh invite otherwise. `POST /api/admin/companies/[id]/resend-invite`.
- **Platform admin: "Eliminar empresa" (danger zone).** A button on the
  company detail permanently deletes a company and everything tied to
  it — every tenant table (via the `accounts` `ON DELETE CASCADE` FKs),
  its storage objects (`account-<id>/` in every bucket), its onboarding
  invitation and support tickets, and each member's `auth.users`
  account. Requires typing the company name to confirm; refuses to
  delete the account the admin is signed in under.
  `POST /api/admin/companies/[id]/delete`.
- **Catalog: categories + per-date room rates (backend).** New
  `product_categories` (a per-account grouping) and `product_rates`
  (weekday vs weekend price, standard vs couple, optional seasonal
  date range). `POST/PATCH /api/products` now accept `category_id` and
  `rates[]`; new `/api/product-categories` CRUD. A pure rate engine
  (`src/lib/products/rates.ts` — `quoteStay` splits a stay night-by-night
  across the weekday/weekend rule). Generic accounts are unaffected.
- **Product form: room rates + category (hotel vertical).** For a `hotel`
  company, the add/edit-product dialog gains a **Category** picker and a
  **"Rates by date (rooms)"** block: Mon–Thu / Fri–Sun prices, standard
  and couple, plus optional dated seasons. Rooms with no rates fall back
  to the base price, so the same form still works for spa / activities /
  packages. The hotel starter kit now also seeds four categories
  (Habitaciones, Spa, Actividades al aire libre, Paquetes).
- **AI sees room rates (hotel vertical).** For a `hotel` company, the
  catalog block in the AI's prompt now shows each room's rate structure
  (`Hab 101: Lun–Jue Q800 · Vie–Dom Q1200 · pareja Lun–Jue Q950 …`)
  instead of a single base price, so it informs tariffs and computes a
  stay correctly. Products with no rates (spa, activities) keep showing
  their base price.
- **Quote builder: room stays priced by night (hotel vertical).** Adding
  a room (a product with rates) to a quote now asks for check-in,
  check-out and occupancy and prices the stay night-by-night across the
  weekday/weekend rule (and any season), shown as one line with the
  nights and dates. It flags any night that has no rate. Other products
  are added as before.
- **Public catalog + Excel: room rates (hotel vertical).** The public
  browse catalog shows a room's rate summary (`Lun–Jue Q800 · Vie–Dom
  Q1200 …`) and per-night breakdown, with a "consultar disponibilidad"
  path instead of add-to-cart (a stay needs dates + a person). The
  products Excel export/import gains `category` and `rate_weekday` /
  `rate_weekend` / `rate_weekday_couple` / `rate_weekend_couple` columns
  — an import creates any new category by name and attaches the rates.
- **Google Sheets: deal rows carry the reservation fields (hotel
  vertical).** For a `hotel` company, a `deal.won` / `deal.stage_changed`
  row now appends the contact's custom fields (Fecha de entrada / salida,
  Habitación, Ocupación, Paquete…), so the deals tab doubles as a
  reservations ledger — filter by the date columns to see which rooms
  are booked. This fires on a manual stage move (the admin confirming),
  unlike `contact.brief_ready` which only the AI / an automation emits.

- **Company industry verticals (platform admin).** Each company now
  carries an *industry* (`generic` or `hotel`). From **Plataforma → the
  company detail**, the operator picks the vertical and clicks **"Aplicar
  kit de arranque"** to seed the right starting config idempotently — for
  `hotel`: a *Reservas* pipeline, reservation custom fields, a welcome
  flow, "Tarifas" / "Políticas y horarios" knowledge-base scaffolds,
  `catalog_delivery_mode = photos`, a restrictive AI prompt, and the
  relevant Google-Sheets events. `generic` is a no-op kit; existing
  accounts are untouched. The vertical also lightly trims the sidebar
  (via `src/lib/verticals`) and shows a read-only line in Settings →
  Negocios. Per-date room pricing for the hotel vertical is a separate
  follow-up.
- **Flow menus: choose what happens on an off-menu reply.** When a
  customer answers a menu step with something that isn't one of the
  options, a flow can now hand the conversation to the AI auto-reply
  (the flow run ends; a later trigger can still start a fresh one),
  alongside the existing reprompt / hand-to-a-human / ignore options.
  This is the default for newly created flows. Editable in the flow
  builder's new **"If the reply isn't one of the options"** panel.
- **Flow builder: channel preview.** A new *Preview* view shows how each
  message the bot sends will look on WhatsApp (clean body + native reply
  buttons / list) versus Instagram & Facebook (options spelled into the
  body as a numbered list + quick-reply chips). One editable flow
  underneath; the view is read-only.
- **Flow builder: pick who a Handoff goes to.** The Handoff node now has
  an *Assign to* picker (any teammate, or the shared queue) in addition
  to its internal note. The engine already routed on this field — it was
  just not editable.

### Fixed

- **Invite / password links no longer die before the recipient clicks.**
  A new owner (or anyone resetting a password) often landed on _"That
  link has expired or was already used"_ because link-preview and
  security scanners (WhatsApp, Gmail, Outlook Safe Links, antivirus
  proxies) fetch the URL to build a preview, and the old link pointed
  straight at Supabase's `/auth/v1/verify`, which consumes the one-time
  token on any GET. Auth e-mail links now land on a new **`/auth/confirm`**
  page — a plain button, no JavaScript, no verification on load — and the
  token is only spent when a human clicks "Confirmar y continuar" (POST →
  `verifyOtp`). `/auth/callback` stays as the path for links already in
  flight. **Manual step (once):** in Supabase → Authentication → Email
  Templates, change the link in **Invite user** and **Reset Password** to
  `{{ .SiteURL }}/auth/confirm?token_hash={{ .TokenHash }}&type=invite&next=/reset-password`
  (use `type=recovery` for the reset template).

- **Flow menus now work on Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp-via-Zernio.**
  A `Send buttons` / `Send list` step could reach a dead end on every
  Zernio-backed channel: the customer's tap arrives as plain text (the
  option label), which the flow runner only ever matched as a native
  interactive reply, so the run just re-prompted and handed off. The
  runner now also advances on a typed reply — the option number
  (`1`, `2)`, `#3`), the exact label, or the option id. On
  Instagram/Facebook the options are additionally written into the
  message body as a numbered list, so the menu stays usable even when
  the quick-reply chips don't render on the customer's client. WhatsApp
  keeps its clean body with native reply buttons.

## [0.9.1] — 2026-09-02

> **Migration required:** apply `supabase/migrations/101_ai_followups_goal.sql`
> (adds `ai_configs.followups_goal`, default `'reply'`). Existing
> follow-up sequences keep running until the customer replies or the
> steps are exhausted; set the goal per account to stop them earlier.

### Added

- **Follow-up conversation goal.** Each account picks what the
  follow-up sequence is trying to achieve — *just get a reply*, *book
  an appointment*, *close the sale*, or *send a quote* — and the
  nudges stop as soon as that happens for the contact (an appointment
  logged, a deal won, a quote created). A chat that gets assigned to a
  person or handed off still stops the sequence regardless.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-09-02

Adds automated follow-up nudges: when a customer goes quiet mid-chat
without booking a demo, Chat Sandía can message them again after a delay.

> **Migration required:** apply `supabase/migrations/099_ai_followups.sql`
> (adds the follow-up settings to `ai_configs` and a new
> `ai_followup_log` table). Then register the sweep on a schedule with
> `supabase/migrations/100_schedule_followups_cron.sql` (pg_cron, every
> ~5 min) and set `FOLLOWUPS_CRON_SECRET` — or reuse
> `AUTOMATION_CRON_SECRET`, which the endpoint accepts as a fallback.
> Until the job is registered the `followups_cron` heartbeat reads
> "never" and the watchdog raises a warning-level alert.

### Added

- **Follow-up messages (Settings → AI).** A per-account toggle plus an
  ordered list of up to 5 steps, each with its own delay and either a
  written message (`{{nombre}}` is filled in) or an approved WhatsApp
  template. A new cron sweep (`/api/ai/followups/cron`) sends the next
  due step for any open, unassigned, not-handed-off WhatsApp
  conversation where the customer stopped replying and no appointment
  is on record. Optional local working-hours window. Written messages
  are held back past WhatsApp's 24h window (templates still send);
  every attempt is recorded in `ai_followup_log` so a step fires once
  and a fresh inbound restarts the sequence.

## [0.8.1] — 2026-07-10

Fixes inbound chats fragmenting into multiple threads for the same
number.

> **Migration required:** apply `supabase/migrations/036_conversation_contact_dedup.sql`
> (merges any existing duplicate conversations into the oldest thread —
> no messages are lost — then adds a `UNIQUE (account_id, contact_id)`
> index so one contact can only ever have one conversation).

### Fixed

- **Duplicate chats for a single contact.** An inbound message could
  create a second conversation for a contact under a race (Meta retries a
  delivery, or a batch fans out to concurrent runs). Once two existed,
  the `.single()` lookup errored on every later message and the webhook
  created yet another conversation each time, snowballing into a wall of
  duplicate chats. The find-or-create now resolves to the oldest existing
  thread and a DB unique index makes the one-conversation-per-contact
  rule authoritative. The same hardening was applied to the public-API
  conversation resolver. (Issue #363)

## [0.8.0] — 2026-07-08

Polishes the AI auto-reply bot: it's now **visible and controllable from
the inbox**, its **handoff actually hands off**, and its **token spend is
logged**.

> **Migration required:** apply `supabase/migrations/033_ai_reply_polish.sql`
> (adds `messages.ai_generated`, `ai_configs.handoff_agent_id`,
> `conversations.ai_handoff_summary`, and the `ai_usage_log` table).

### Added

- **"AI" badge in the inbox.** Replies the bot sent are tagged with a
  small ✨ AI badge, so agents can tell an automated reply from their own
  or a Flow's at a glance. (New `messages.ai_generated` flag; only the
  auto-reply bot sets it.)
- **Take over / Resume from the thread.** A banner on AI-handled
  conversations lets an agent **Take over** (pauses the bot for that
  thread and assigns it to them) or **Resume AI** (hands the thread back
  and clears the pause). Backed by `POST /api/ai/autoreply/[id]`.
- **Real handoff.** When the bot bails (can't help, or hits the reply
  cap) it now (1) routes the conversation to a configurable **handoff
  target** — a specific agent, or the unassigned queue — and (2) leaves a
  short **internal note** summarizing the exchange for whoever picks it
  up. Assigning fires the existing assignment notification. Pick the
  target under **AI Agents → Setup → Hand off to**.
- **Token-usage logging + dashboard.** Every draft and auto-reply records
  its provider token counts to the new `ai_usage_log` table
  (admin-readable). A new **AI Agents → Usage** tab (admin-only) charts
  daily token spend on your BYO key with per-mode and per-model
  breakdowns, backed by `GET /api/ai/usage`. Counts only — no message
  content is stored or shown.

### Changed

- Auto-reply now has an **account-wide rate limit** (30/min) on top of
  the existing per-conversation cap, so a burst of inbound can't run your
  provider key past its limit. Over the limit, inbounds simply wait in
  the inbox for a human instead of being auto-answered.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-07-02

Promotes the AI assistant to a first-class **AI Agents** section in the
sidebar — it's no longer tucked inside Settings.

### Added

- **AI Agents (sidebar).** A dedicated `/agents` area with two tabs:
  - **Playground** — a test chat to message your agent and see its
    grounded, multi-turn replies (and where it would hand off to a human)
    *before* it ever answers a real customer. Runs the exact same path as
    the auto-reply bot (knowledge-base retrieval + your provider), and
    works even before you flip the master switch on, so you can try, then
    enable. Backed by `POST /api/ai/playground`.
  - **Setup** — the provider/key, business context, knowledge base, and
    auto-reply controls (moved here from Settings → AI Assistant).

### Changed

- The AI configuration moved out of **Settings → AI Assistant** into the
  new **AI Agents** section. No data change — same account config, new
  home. No migration required.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-07-02

Adds an **AI knowledge base** so the assistant (0.5.0) can answer from
your own content instead of handing off. Paste FAQs, policies, or
product details under **Settings → AI Assistant → Knowledge base**; the
relevant excerpts are retrieved into every draft and auto-reply.

### Added

- **Knowledge base with hybrid retrieval.** Lexical Postgres full-text
  search works for every account with no extra credentials. Optional
  **semantic search** (pgvector, OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small`) turns
  on when you add an **embeddings key** — semantic-primary, topped up
  with lexical to fill the result set. Anthropic-only accounts (Anthropic
  has no embeddings API) keep the lexical path with zero extra setup.
- **Knowledge base manager** in Settings — add/edit/delete documents and
  a **Reindex** action to backfill embeddings after adding a key. Both
  drafts and the auto-reply bot are grounded in the retrieved excerpts,
  and the prompt still instructs the model to hand off (auto-reply) or
  say it will follow up (draft) when the KB doesn't cover the question.
  **Migration required:** apply `supabase/migrations/030_ai_knowledge.sql`
  (enables `pgvector`; adds `ai_knowledge_documents` + `ai_knowledge_chunks`
  and an `embeddings_api_key` column on `ai_configs`).

## [0.5.0] — 2026-07-02

Adds the **AI reply assistant** — bring-your-own-key. Each account
pastes its own OpenAI or Anthropic key under **Settings → AI
Assistant**; wacrm calls the provider directly with that key, so
there's no per-seat AI fee and your conversation data never leaves
your own infrastructure for a wacrm-run service. The key is stored
AES-256-GCM-encrypted at rest (same as WhatsApp tokens) and never
returned to the client after saving.

### Added

- **AI-drafted replies in the inbox.** A ✨ button in the composer
  (agent+) reads the recent conversation and drops a suggested reply
  into the box for the agent to edit and send. Read-only server-side —
  `POST /api/ai/draft` never sends or stores anything. Respects your
  business context / persona from the settings prompt.
- **AI auto-reply bot.** When enabled, inbound messages that no
  deterministic Flow consumed and that have no agent assigned get an
  automatic LLM reply. Bounded by a per-conversation cap
  (`auto_reply_max_per_conversation`, default 3) and a clean human
  handoff: when the model can't confidently help — or the customer
  asks for a person — it stays silent and leaves the message for a
  human, and won't auto-reply on that thread again until re-enabled.
  Flows always win over the bot.
- **Settings → AI Assistant** (admin+ to edit): pick provider + model,
  paste your key, add business context/tone, toggle the assistant and
  auto-reply, set the per-conversation cap, and **Test key** against
  the provider before saving.
- Providers: OpenAI (Chat Completions) and Anthropic (Messages) behind
  one interface; model is a free-text field with sensible defaults, so
  you can point it at any current model your key can access.
  **Migration required:** apply
  `supabase/migrations/029_ai_reply.sql` (adds `ai_configs` +
  per-conversation auto-reply columns on `conversations`).

## [0.4.0] — 2026-07-01

Completes the public API (#245): **outbound event webhooks** so
automations can *react* to activity instead of polling.

### Added

- **Outbound event webhooks (`/api/v1/webhooks`).** Register an HTTPS
  endpoint (scope `webhooks:manage`) to be POSTed to when an event
  happens in your account — `message.received`, `message.status_updated`,
  or `conversation.created`. Manage endpoints with
  `GET/POST /api/v1/webhooks` and `GET/PATCH/DELETE /api/v1/webhooks/{id}`.
  Each delivery is signed with an `X-Wacrm-Signature`
  (HMAC-SHA256 over `timestamp.body`) so receivers can verify
  authenticity and reject replays; the signing secret is returned once
  at creation and stored encrypted. Delivery is best-effort — an
  endpoint that fails repeatedly is auto-disabled after a threshold of
  consecutive failures. See `docs/public-api.md`.
  **Migration required:** apply
  `supabase/migrations/028_webhook_endpoints.sql`.
  ([#245](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/issues/245))

## [0.3.0] — 2026-07-01

Multi-user accounts ship. Every wacrm install is multi-tenant on the
database side: a single user's signup creates a fresh "account", and
every row is scoped to that account rather than to the user directly.
This release also opens the user-visible **Members** surface — invite
teammates by link, manage their roles, transfer ownership — to all
users. The `'account_sharing'` beta gate that hid it during
development is removed (mirrors the Flows soft-GA in 0.2.0). Existing
self-hosted instances keep working: every existing user is backfilled
as the sole owner of their own account and sees identical data, and a
solo owner who never invites anyone sees the same single-user app they
always did.

### Added

- **Public REST API (`/api/v1`) — groundwork.** A scoped, revocable
  **API key** system so you can drive wacrm from your own scripts and
  automations. Create keys under **Settings → API keys** (admin+),
  grant only the scopes each integration needs, and authenticate with
  `Authorization: Bearer <key>`. Keys are account-scoped and stored
  hashed (plaintext shown once). This release ships the auth layer,
  scopes, per-key rate limiting, the management UI, and a
  `GET /api/v1/me` probe to verify a key. See
  `docs/public-api.md`. **Migration required:** apply
  `supabase/migrations/026_api_keys.sql`. ([#245](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/issues/245))
- **Public REST API — data endpoints.** Built on the key auth above,
  so external automations can read and drive the CRM:
  - `POST /api/v1/messages` — send a text / template / media message to
    a phone number; finds-or-creates the contact + conversation
    (`messages:send`).
  - `GET/POST /api/v1/contacts`, `GET/PATCH /api/v1/contacts/{id}` —
    list (search + tag filter), create (find-or-create by phone), read,
    and update contacts, including tags (`contacts:read` /
    `contacts:write`).
  - `GET /api/v1/conversations`, `GET /api/v1/conversations/{id}`, and
    `GET /api/v1/conversations/{id}/messages` — browse conversations and
    their message history with delivery status (`conversations:read` /
    `messages:read`).
  - `POST /api/v1/broadcasts` + `GET /api/v1/broadcasts/{id}` — launch a
    template broadcast to a recipient list and poll its progress
    (`broadcasts:send`).
  All list endpoints share one cursor-pagination contract
  (`{ data, meta: { next_cursor } }`). No migration required — the
  scopes already existed and the tables are unchanged. Outbound event
  webhooks (react to inbound messages) are the remaining roadmap item.
  See `docs/public-api.md`. ([#245](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/issues/245))

### Changed

- **Tenancy moves from per-user to per-account.** RLS on every
  domain table (contacts, conversations, messages, broadcasts,
  automations, flows, pipelines, templates, tags, …) now checks
  account membership via a new SECURITY DEFINER helper
  `is_account_member(account_id, min_role)` instead of
  `auth.uid() = user_id`. The `user_id` columns stay on every row
  for assignment / audit but no longer enforce isolation.
- **WhatsApp config is one-per-account, not one-per-user.** The
  `whatsapp_config.UNIQUE(user_id)` constraint is replaced by
  `UNIQUE(account_id)`.
- **`flow_runs` idempotency key swaps to `(account_id, contact_id)`**
  so two accounts sharing a contact phone number can each run their
  own flows independently.
- **The signup trigger (`handle_new_user`) now also creates a
  personal account** and links the new profile to it as `owner`.

### Changed

- **Flow-media storage is now account-scoped.** Migration 016
  pathed uploaded files under `auth.uid()/...`, which orphaned
  flow media when a teammate left a shared account. New uploads
  go under `account-<account_id>/...` and any account member
  with the right role can edit them. Legacy paths remain
  writable by the original uploader for backward compatibility.
- **Webhook contact lookup now pre-filters in SQL.** Previously
  pulled every contact in an account just to JS-filter to one
  row by phone — fine when account = one user, painful when
  account = team. Pre-filter by phone suffix on the database
  side; re-apply `phonesMatch` on the (typically 0-2 row)
  candidate set.

### Migration required

- `supabase/migrations/020_account_sharing_followups.sql` —
  composite partial indexes on `automations(account_id,
  trigger_type) WHERE is_active` and `flows(account_id) WHERE
  status='active'` for the engine dispatch hot path; updated
  `flow-media` storage RLS to allow account-member writes under
  the new path convention. Idempotent.

- **Role-aware UI gating across the app.** The inbox composer's
  send button + textarea, the "New broadcast / automation / flow"
  buttons, the "Add pipeline / deal" buttons, and the "Add /
  Import contact" buttons are now disabled-with-tooltip for
  viewers (and for agents on settings-class actions). Choice:
  show-but-disable rather than hide, so the UI never feels
  silently broken to a teammate looking at a feature they don't
  yet have permission for.
- **Sidebar surfaces the active account** above the user info
  whenever the account name differs from your own — i.e. once
  you've renamed the account or joined a shared one. A default
  solo account is named after you, so the strip stays hidden to
  avoid duplicating your name in the footer.
- **Members is open to all users.** The `account_sharing` beta
  flag that hid the Settings → Members tab and the sidebar
  account strip during development is gone; the multi-user
  surface is now part of the standard app. (Same soft-GA move as
  Flows in 0.2.0.)

### Fixed

- **Inbound WhatsApp messages now land in the shared inbox.** The
  webhook + automations + flows engines used to route inbound
  events by `user_id`, which after the 017 migration only matched
  the WhatsApp config owner's automations / flows — teammates'
  rules never fired. PR 8 of the multi-user series flips every
  lookup to `account_id` so any member of the account sees the
  inbound message and any teammate's automation or flow can react
  to it. Also fixes incipient NOT NULL violations on
  `automation_logs`, `automation_pending_executions`, `flow_runs`,
  and `deals` — those tables gained `account_id NOT NULL` in 017
  but the engines hadn't yet been updated to populate it.

### Added

- **Duplicate phone numbers are now prevented across contacts.** A
  phone number can no longer become more than one contact in the same
  account. Adding a contact whose number already exists is blocked
  with a link to the existing record (and a softer warning for
  near-matches that share their last 8 digits); CSV import de-dupes
  within the file and against existing contacts, reporting
  "X imported, Y duplicates skipped". The rule is enforced by a
  database unique index on the normalized number, so the WhatsApp
  webhook, the form, import, and any future path all agree. Existing
  duplicates are merged into the oldest contact on upgrade (their
  conversations, deals, notes, and tags are re-pointed, nothing is
  lost). Closes #212.
- **Configurable default deal currency.** Each account can now pick
  its default currency under **Settings → Deals** (admin+); the app
  previously hardcoded USD throughout. New deals default to it, and
  pipeline-stage totals, the dashboard "Open Deals Value" card, the
  pipeline-value donut, and automation-created deals all use it.
  Existing deals keep the currency they were saved with — totals are
  shown in the account default with no exchange-rate conversion (one
  currency per account). Full guide:
  [Default currency](https://wacrm.tech/docs/settings#deals).
- **Members tab in Settings.** The user-facing surface for the
  multi-user APIs below, available to everyone (no beta flag). From
  Settings → **Members** an admin or owner can: see who's on the
  account with their role and join date, invite teammates by
  generating a one-time share link (pick the role + optional
  expiry), revoke pending invites, change a member's role, remove a
  member, and — as owner — transfer ownership. Recipients accept via
  a public `/join/[token]` page. Full guide:
  [Members docs](https://wacrm.tech/docs/members).
- **Account & member management API** — server-side endpoints
  backing the Members tab. All routes are role-gated and
  return Supabase-RLS-scoped data.
  - `GET /api/account` — caller's account + role. Any member.
  - `PATCH /api/account` — rename the account. Admin+.
  - `GET /api/account/members` — list members. Email visible to
    admin+ only; agents/viewers see name + avatar + role +
    joined date.
  - `PATCH /api/account/members/[userId]` — change a member's
    role. Admin+. Owner promotion/demotion goes through the
    transfer endpoint instead.
  - `DELETE /api/account/members/[userId]` — remove a member.
    Admin+. The removed user keeps their login and is moved to a
    freshly-created personal account (mirror of the signup flow).
  - `POST /api/account/transfer-ownership` — owner only. Atomic
    swap with the named member.
- **Invitation API + redeem flow** — the no-email, link-only
  invite path that powers the Members tab's "Invite member" button
  and the `/join/[token]` accept page.
  - `GET /api/account/invitations` — list outstanding (admin+).
  - `POST /api/account/invitations` — create an invite, returns
    the plaintext token + share URL **exactly once** (we store
    only the SHA-256 hash on the row). Body
    `{ role, expiresInDays?, label? }`. Admin+.
  - `DELETE /api/account/invitations/[id]` — revoke (admin+).
  - `GET /api/invitations/[token]/peek` — public, per-IP
    rate-limited. Returns `{ ok, account_name, role, expires_at }`
    or `{ ok: false, reason }` so the join page can render
    "You're being invited to <Account> as <Role>".
  - `POST /api/invitations/[token]/redeem` — authenticated.
    Atomically moves the caller's profile to the inviter's
    account and cleans up the orphan personal account. Refuses
    with 409 if the caller's current account already contains
    domain data (no silent data loss).

### Migration required

Apply against your Supabase project before deploying this version:

- `supabase/migrations/017_account_sharing.sql` — introduces the
  `accounts` and `account_invitations` tables plus an
  `account_role_enum` type; adds `account_id` to every
  user-scoped table and backfills it; rewrites every RLS policy;
  replaces the new-user trigger. Idempotent. **No data loss** —
  every existing user is mapped to a freshly-created account
  with role `owner` and every existing row of theirs is linked
  to that account.
- `supabase/migrations/018_account_member_rpcs.sql` — adds three
  `SECURITY DEFINER` RPCs (`set_member_role`,
  `remove_account_member`, `transfer_account_ownership`) that
  back the member-management API. They self-check the caller's
  role and raise SQLSTATE `42501` / `22023` on forbidden / bad
  input so the API layer can map cleanly to 403 / 400.
  Idempotent.
- `supabase/migrations/019_invitation_rpcs.sql` — adds two
  `SECURITY DEFINER` RPCs: `peek_invitation` (anonymous read by
  token hash, returns a fixed-shape JSON envelope) and
  `redeem_invitation` (authenticated atomic move + orphan
  cleanup, with a domain-data safety check). Both bypass the
  RLS that would otherwise block their reads/writes. Idempotent.
- `supabase/migrations/021_account_default_currency.sql` — adds
  `accounts.default_currency` (`TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'USD'`, with a
  3-letter-code `CHECK`) backing the configurable default currency.
  Idempotent; existing accounts backfill to `USD`. **Apply before
  deploying** — the app now reads this column when loading the
  account, so an un-migrated database breaks account loading.
- `supabase/migrations/022_contact_phone_dedup.sql` — adds the
  generated `contacts.phone_normalized` column, **merges existing
  duplicate contacts into the oldest** (re-pointing conversations,
  deals, notes, tags, custom values, and broadcast recipients — no
  data loss), then adds a `UNIQUE (account_id, phone_normalized)`
  index. Idempotent. **Apply before deploying** — CSV import reads
  `phone_normalized`, and the index is what enforces de-duplication
  for every write path. The one-shot merge runs inside the migration.

## [0.2.2] — 2026-05-29

Flow nodes can now send media. Closes the most-requested gap from user
feedback after the v0.2.0 Flows launch — flows were text-only and
couldn't deliver an invoice, receipt, product photo, or short demo
video mid-conversation.

### Added

- **`send_media` flow node.** Send an image (PNG / JPEG / WebP), video
  (MP4 / 3GP), or document (PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, TXT) to the
  customer from any point in a flow. Pick a file in the builder, it
  uploads to the new `flow-media` Supabase Storage bucket, and Meta
  fetches the public URL at send time. Optional caption (1024 char cap,
  supports `{{vars.X}}` interpolation); documents also take an optional
  filename shown in the recipient's chat. Auto-advances after send —
  same suspend semantics as `send_message`.
  ([#156](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/156))

### Migration required

Apply against your Supabase project before deploying this version:

- `supabase/migrations/016_flow_media.sql` — does two things:
  1. Adds `'send_media'` to the `flow_nodes.node_type` CHECK
     constraint. Without this the `send_media` node fails to save with
     a constraint violation.
  2. Creates the public `flow-media` Supabase Storage bucket (16 MB
     file-size cap, image / video / document MIME allowlist) plus
     per-user RLS policies (path prefix = `auth.uid()`). Without this
     the builder's file picker fails on upload. Same shape as the
     `avatars` bucket from migration 008 — the bucket is **public** so
     Meta can fetch the URL without credentials.

The migration is idempotent and safe to re-run.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-05-26

Bug-fix release. Plugs a silent inbound-message drop that triggered
when two users on the same instance saved the same WhatsApp
`phone_number_id`.

### Fixed

- **Inbound WhatsApp messages no longer silently disappear** when two
  users have claimed the same `phone_number_id`. Previously the
  webhook used `.single()` to look up the owning config, which errors
  `PGRST116` for both 0 rows *and* ≥2 rows — the second user's save
  put the DB into the ≥2-row state and every inbound message was
  dropped while the log misleadingly reported *"No config found for
  phone_number_id"*. Three layers of fix: `POST /api/whatsapp/config`
  now returns **409** when another user has already claimed the
  number, the webhook lookup distinguishes 0 rows from ≥2 rows and
  logs the conflicting `user_id`s, and a new DB constraint
  (`UNIQUE(phone_number_id)`) prevents the bad state at the storage
  layer. Reported in
  [#136](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/issues/136), fixed in
  [#143](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/143).

### Migration required

Apply against your Supabase project before deploying this version:

- `supabase/migrations/013_whatsapp_config_phone_number_id_unique.sql`
  — adds `UNIQUE(phone_number_id)` to `whatsapp_config`. **Fails
  loudly with a copy-pasteable resolution hint** if duplicate rows
  already exist; auto-deduping would destroy encrypted tokens, so
  the operator picks which row keeps the number. To check first:

  ```sql
  SELECT phone_number_id, array_agg(user_id) AS owners, count(*) AS n
  FROM whatsapp_config
  GROUP BY phone_number_id
  HAVING count(*) > 1;
  ```

  If that returns rows, `DELETE` the duplicate row(s) you want to
  drop, then re-run the migration.

### Note on multi-user setups

wacrm is intentionally **single-tenant per WhatsApp number**. RLS on
`conversations`/`messages` is `auth.uid() = user_id`, so a second
user physically cannot read messages routed to a different owner —
two users sharing one number was never supported. If you need
multiple humans handling the same inbox, run them under one shared
account.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-22

The **Flows** release. Adds a no-code, branching, button-driven WhatsApp
conversation engine that runs alongside Automations. Also ships a
5-theme color picker in Settings and opens Flows to all users.

### Added

#### Flows — branching chatbot conversations

- **Module + schema.** New `flows`, `flow_nodes`, `flow_runs`,
  `flow_run_events` tables with partial unique indexes that enforce
  one active run per contact. Widened `messages.content_type` CHECK
  to accept `'interactive'`; added `interactive_reply_id` column so
  the inbox can render button/list taps.
  ([#112](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/112))
- **Runner engine.** `dispatchInboundToFlows` parses every inbound
  webhook, decides whether the message is a reply on an active run
  or a fresh trigger, advances the state machine, and reports back
  to the webhook so consumed messages don't also fire automations.
  Idempotent on Meta's `message_id`.
  ([#114](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/114))
- **No-code builder UI** at `/flows`. Linear-list editor with
  per-node config forms, live validator, draft/active/archived
  status, and a 5-route REST API (`GET/POST /api/flows`,
  `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/flows/[id]`, `POST /api/flows/[id]/activate`,
  `GET /api/flows/[id]/runs`, `GET /api/flows/templates`).
  ([#115](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/115))
- **Templates + v1.5 node types.** Three starter templates
  (Welcome menu, FAQ bot, Lead capture) cloneable from the New-flow
  dialog. Three new node types: `collect_input` (capture customer
  text into a variable), `condition` (branch on var / tag / contact
  field), `set_tag` (add or remove a tag). `{{vars.X}}` interpolation
  in send_message + collect_input prompts. Per-flow run-history
  viewer at `/flows/[id]/runs`.
  ([#117](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/117))
- **Stale-run sweep cron** at `GET /api/flows/cron` — marks runs
  past their configured timeout (default 24h) as `timed_out` so
  abandoned conversations free up the contact for new triggers.
  Reuses `AUTOMATION_CRON_SECRET`.
  ([#114](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/114))

#### Color themes

- **5 color themes** (Violet default, Emerald, Cobalt, Amber, Rose)
  selectable from a new **Appearance** tab in Settings. CSS variables
  scoped under `html[data-theme="..."]`, applied at runtime via
  `dataset.theme`, persisted to `localStorage`. Inline boot script in
  `layout.tsx` replays the choice before first paint so there's no
  flash of the default.
  ([#132](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/132))
- **Theme tokenization sweep** — every previously hard-coded
  `violet-*` Tailwind class replaced with `primary` tokens across
  ~49 files. Picking a non-violet theme now themes the whole app,
  not just the chrome.
  ([#133](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/133))

### Changed

#### Flows — soft-GA

- **Flows is now available to every authenticated user.** The
  per-account beta gate is gone; the sidebar entry + page header
  carry a small "Beta" chip as the only remaining signal.
  ([#134](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/134))
- **Editor UX**:
  - Internal `node_key` + per-button/row `reply_id` identifiers
    hidden behind a per-node "Show advanced" disclosure.
    ([#118](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/118))
  - `send_list` nodes can have multiple sections.
    ([#119](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/119))
  - Collapsed node cards show a 1-line content preview per node
    type (text excerpt, button titles, condition summary, etc.).
    ([#120](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/120))
  - Validation issues are clickable: jump to + flash the offending
    node.
    ([#121](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/121))
  - Unsaved-changes "● Edited" indicator + `beforeunload` reload
    guard.
    ([#122](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/122))
  - New-flow dialog actually widens to fit the 3 template cards
    (was capped at 384px by a baked-in `sm:max-w-sm` from shadcn).
    ([#129](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/129),
    [#131](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/131))
  - Validation panel pinned to the viewport bottom so
    activate-readiness follows the user as they scroll through nodes.
    ([#130](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/130))

#### Engine reliability

- **Atomic `execution_count` increment** via SECURITY DEFINER RPC —
  prevents lost counts when two webhooks start runs concurrently.
  Mirrors the automations engine pattern.
  ([#124](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/124))
- **Preload all flow_nodes once per dispatch** — one SELECT per
  inbound instead of one per advance-loop iteration. A 5-node
  auto-advance chain now costs 1 round trip, not 5.
  ([#125](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/125))
- **Wasted re-read dropped** after reprompt reset; `loadActiveRun`
  switched to defensive `.limit(1)` so a migration glitch producing
  duplicates can't crash dispatch.
  ([#126](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/126))

### Security

- **PII redacted from `reply_received` event payload** — customer
  text is no longer persisted to `flow_run_events.payload`; only
  the length is. A `collect_input` prompt asking "what's your card
  number?" used to leave the PAN sitting in the events table.
  ([#123](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/123))
- **Constant-time cron-secret compare** on `/api/flows/cron`
  (`crypto.timingSafeEqual`) to close a theoretical
  timing-side-channel on the `x-cron-secret` header check.
  ([#127](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/127))

### Fixed

- **`/flows` no longer spuriously redirects to `/dashboard`** when
  navigating in. Root cause: `useAuth` flipped `loading: false`
  before the profile fetch resolved. `use-auth` now exposes a
  separate `profileLoading` boolean.
  ([#128](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/128))

### Migration required

Apply, in order, against your Supabase project:

1. `supabase/migrations/010_flows.sql` — Flows core tables, indexes,
   RLS policies, and the `messages` schema widening.
2. `supabase/migrations/011_profile_beta_features.sql` — adds the
   `profiles.beta_features` column. Surviving for future betas;
   Flows no longer reads it.
3. `supabase/migrations/012_flows_increment_counter.sql` — atomic
   counter RPC. Without this the engine still runs but
   `flows.execution_count` is racy.

Each migration is idempotent — safe to re-run if you're not sure
whether you applied a previous one.

### Removed

- **`src/lib/flows/feature-flag.ts`** + its tests. Flows is open to
  all users; the `profiles.beta_features` column itself survives
  for future beta gates.
  ([#134](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/134))

---

## [0.1.1] — 2026-05-19

### Added

- Chat actions in the inbox: emoji reactions, reply-with-quote, and
  copy-text on individual messages. Hover on desktop, long-press on
  touch. Outbound reactions and replies forward to WhatsApp via the
  Cloud API; inbound reactions and swipe-replies from customers
  arrive through the webhook and appear in real time.

### Migration required

- Apply `supabase/migrations/009_message_actions.sql` to your
  Supabase project. It adds `messages.reply_to_message_id` and the
  new `message_reactions` table (with RLS and realtime). The
  migration is idempotent — safe to re-run.

### Changed

- The webhook no longer stores inbound customer reactions as fake
  text messages. They are written to `message_reactions` instead,
  so any custom queries that counted reactions as messages will
  need updating.

---

## [0.1.0]

Initial template release. Core CRM: inbox, contacts, pipelines,
broadcasts, automations (with a Wait-step cron drain), WhatsApp
Cloud API integration, Supabase auth + RLS.
